# PY-CL-Inheritance


## Overview

This project focuses on implementing inheritance in Python classes. It includes a base class `Vehicle` and a subclass `Car`, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding. The project also includes an entry point script (`app.py`) to test the functionality of the `Car` class, along with unit tests (`lab_test.py`) to ensure the correctness of the implemented inheritance.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It instantiates objects of the `Car` class and tests their functionality by calling various methods.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the `Vehicle` and `Car` classes. It demonstrates inheritance by having the `Car` class inherit from the `Vehicle` class. Additionally, it showcases method overriding in the `Car` class.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the classes and methods defined in `lab.py`. It ensures that the inheritance hierarchy is correctly implemented and that method overriding works as expected.

## Project Structure

- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started

1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Run the `app.py` file to test the functionality of the `Car` class.
3. Review the code in `lab.py` to understand the implementation of inheritance and method overriding.

## Testing

1. Open the `src/test/lab_test.py` file.
2. Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
3. Ensure that all tests pass, confirming the correctness of the inheritance implementation and method overriding.

## Conclusion

This project provides practical experience with inheritance and method overriding in Python classes. By exploring the code in `lab.py` and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can deepen their understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

Happy Coding!
